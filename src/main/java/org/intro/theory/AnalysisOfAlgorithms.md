## Analysis of Algorithms

The key aspect to focus on while analyzing an algorithm is its running time.

A framework for predicting the performance and comparing the running time of algorithms.

### Scientific method
1. <r>Observe</r> some feature of the natural world
2. <r>Hypothesize</r> a model that is consistent with the observation
3. <r>Predict</r> events using the hypothesis
4. <r>Verify</r> the predictions while making further observations
5. <r>Validate</r> by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree

Tilda Notation - Estimate the running time as the function of input size N. Ignore the lower order terms when N is large.
Need liner or linearithmic algorithms to keep up with Moore's law.
