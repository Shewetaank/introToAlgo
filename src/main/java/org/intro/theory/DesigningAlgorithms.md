# Theory related to the algorithms design

In order to solve the algorithm problems during interview questions follow the below approach- 

1. model the problem
2. find an algo to solve it
3. is it fast enough? fits in memory?
4. if not, figure out why
5. find a way to address the problem
6. iterate until solved
